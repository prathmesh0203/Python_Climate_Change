# Python_Climate_Change
**Motivation**

-Game theory offers a lot to whether or not countries decide to engage in 
climate action.

-The “players” end up being the individual countries that try to choose options that would help them secure the best outcomes for themselves.

-They then engage in “games” that embrace the idea of interdependence where the outcomes for the “players” or countries depend on what strategies others act on.

-Climate change can be treated as an iterated game where there is a common-pool resource that is available to everyone. If managed correctly, these resources can sustain and provide value to many parties, but when too much is taken too quickly, the resource can easily be depleted.

-Therefore, the “game” must be set up in a way to reward cooperation and stop individual “players” from free riding from other’s contributions.

-We will try to recreate the results from the paper  "Climate change governance, cooperation and self-organization"
